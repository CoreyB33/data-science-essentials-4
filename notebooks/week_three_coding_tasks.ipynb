    "1. First, (if you haven't done so already), create a new column indicating the SHADAC classification for each Tennessee county. You can use the following code to accomplish this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "physicians.loc[physicians['residents_per_pcp'] < 1500, 'shadac_category'] = 'adequate'\n",
    "physicians.loc[(physicians['residents_per_pcp'] >= 1500) & \n",
    "          (physicians['residents_per_pcp'] < 3500), 'shadac_category'] = 'moderately inadequate'\n",
    "physicians.loc[(physicians['residents_per_pcp'] >= 3500), 'shadac_category'] = 'low inadequate'\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Use this new column to investigate if there is any relationship between a county's status as urban or rural and its SHADAC classification. Create a plot showing what you find.\n",
    "3. Merge the unemployment data (contained in tn_unemployment.csv) into the physicians DataFrame.\n",
    "4. How do unemployment rates compare for urban counties versus rural counties?\n",
    "5. Create a new column, `pcp_per_100k` which contains the number of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents. Investigate the relationship between this new measure and the unemployment rate per county. What do you find?"
